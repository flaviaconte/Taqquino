# taqquino  
*A space to make mistakes.*

## Why “taqquino”?

The name **taqquino** comes from a common spelling mistake that children make when they first learn how to write the Italian word *taccuino* (“notebook”).  
This app plays with that error on purpose: instead of correcting it, we use the mistake.  
**taqquino** is designed as a safe space where you are free to fail, try again, and discover new ways to express yourself.

## Concept and inspiration

The concept of taqquino is inspired by Edvard Munch’s painting **“The Sick Child”**, where the artist said he wanted viewers to almost *smell* the illness.  
This idea of **synesthesia** – mixing senses like sight, smell, sound, and touch – shows how powerful it can be to involve the whole body in an artistic experience.

Starting from this, taqquino explores how drawing can be **multi-sensory and inclusive**, especially for people with visual impairments or blindness. The goal is to create an experience where art is not only something you see, but also something you **feel and hear**.

## Automatic drawing

taqquino is based on the practice of **automatic drawing**.  
Automatic drawing is a technique where you let your hand move freely, without planning the result or judging the outcome. The focus is on **process, not perfection**. Anyone can do it, regardless of their drawing skills, and it can be a **therapeutic, playful, and liberating** practice.

In taqquino, automatic drawing is supported by:

- An initial phase using **Apple Pencil**, to create your doodle.
- A second phase using your **fingers**, to revisit and explore the lines you already drew.

This second step is essential: you are invited to **re-discover your own traces** through haptic feedbacks and sound.

## Multi-sensory and accessible experience

taqquino focuses especially on **touch and hearing**:

- **Haptic feedback** (via Core Haptics) to feel the gesture while drawing.
- **VoiceOver support** to guide and describe the interface and actions.
- **Sound design** related to the materials and tools used while creating your doodle (for example, different sounds for different brushes or surfaces).

The experience is designed to be **accessible and inclusive** from the beginning, so that people with different abilities can participate in the creative process.

## Future directions

For future iterations, taqquino plans to explore more accessibility and AI-driven features, including:

- **Updatable Classifier Drawing** to help recognize shapes and forms with the support of AI.
- Deeper integration with **VoiceOver** to describe drawings and interactions in richer ways.
- Expanded use of **Core Haptics** to create more nuanced tactile feedback.
- More work on **colors and materials**, both visual and conceptual, to reinforce the synesthetic experience.

taqquino is an experiment in **using mistakes**, **expanding the senses**, and **making artistic practice accessible to everyone**.
